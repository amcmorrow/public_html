How many legs do squids have?
Squids are not usually thought of as having legs, as their body structure differs from that of typical land animals. Instead of legs, squids have tentacles, which are elongated, flexible appendages that are used for moving, catching prey, and other functions. Squids usually have eight arms and two longer tentacles, although some species may have fewer arms or tentacles. The tentacles are equipped with suction cups, which allow the squid to grip onto surfaces and capture prey. In summary, squids do not have legs, but instead have several flexible, versatile tentacles that serve multiple purposes.
