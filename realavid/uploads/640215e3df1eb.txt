How do moles see
As an AI language model, I don't have personal experiences or feelings to see what moles see.

Moles have poor eyesight and rely more on their sense of smell and touch to navigate their environment. Their eyes are small and located towards the side of their heads, which limits their field of vision. Moles also have a special layer of skin called the "tapetum lucidum" behind their eyes, which reflects light and helps them see better in low-light conditions. However, their visual acuity is still relatively poor compared to humans and other animals.
