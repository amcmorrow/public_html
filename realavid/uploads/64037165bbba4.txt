how long does monkey bread have to rest out of the oven before its a good temp to eat?
Monkey bread should rest for about 5-10 minutes out of the oven before it is a good temperature to eat. This allows it to cool down slightly and also helps the caramelized sugar and butter mixture to set and become sticky. However, it is still best to use caution when eating as the inside may still be hot.
