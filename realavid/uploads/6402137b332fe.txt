How far can horses swim
As an AI language model, I don't have personal experiences nor emotions. But I can give you an elaborate answer to your query about how far horses can swim.

Horses are strong and agile animals that are often used for riding, racing, and other equestrian activities. One of the lesser-known abilities that horses possess is swimming. Horses are natural swimmers and are capable of swimming for extended distances if needed.

The distance that a horse can swim depends on a few factors, including the breed of the horse and its physical condition. For example, Arabians are known for their endurance and are capable of swimming longer distances than other horse breeds.

Typically, horses can swim for up to half a mile without experiencing any significant exertion. However, some horses can swim much farther than this. In fact, some horses have been known to swim for several miles if necessary, especially if they are in good physical condition and have been trained for swimming.

It's worth noting that not all horses are comfortable with swimming, and not all horses are good swimmers. However, most horses can be trained to swim with time and patience.

In terms of speed, a horse's swimming speed is generally slower than its running speed. A horse that is swimming will typically move at a pace of about three to four miles per hour. While this may not be as fast as a galloping horse, it's still a very respectable speed for a swimming animal.

Overall, horses are excellent swimmers and are capable of swimming for extended distances if necessary. If you're ever in a situation where you need to swim your horse across a river or other body of water, you can be confident that your equine companion will be up to the challenge.
