Make a joke about someone named Haley Fleming.
Well, have you heard about Haley Fleming? She's such a funny gal!

Once she walked into a bar and ordered a French Fry sandwich! Yes, you heard it right - French Fry sandwich. The bartender was so startled that he asked her if she wanted anything to drink with that.

And do you know what Haley replied? She said, "Of course, I want a glass of French fry shake please!"

Everyone in the bar started laughing, and the bartender just couldn't keep a straight face anymore. Eventually, they gave her what she wanted, and Haley enjoyed her unconventional meal with a big smile on her face.

From that day onwards, everyone knew Haley Fleming as the girl who had a thing for French fries. But hey, it's all good - at least she doesn't discriminate against other foods!
